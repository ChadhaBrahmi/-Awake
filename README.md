## What is !awake?
**!awake** is an experimental AI storytelling project that transforms short dream descriptions into complete narrative stories , built as part of my journey in learning machine learning from scratch , the project checks how language models can expand minimal human input into structured, imaginative output for now.

## Why this idea specifically?

I have always had vivid and unusual dreams whose plots often felt rich enough to become full stories . However, I rarely had the time to write them into complete narratives. This led me to wonder whether An AI model could help by turning a description of a dream into a full story, written in a way similar to my own style saving me time and helping me create something as creative as what a human brain can write.

### Experimenting with AI Models

To reach my goal with **!Awake**, I experimented with different AI agents. I started with **Gemini** , testing how it could expand short inputs into complete stories and trying to get it to match my writing style .
